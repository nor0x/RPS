My implementation of RPS / RPSLS


possible refactorings
- put XAML styles into Resources or ResourceDictionaries
- reading strings from a config file
- a general function for reading from a JSON file, insted of having two functions that do the same
- subclass Player for different player types and more granularity
- showing a dialog or other UI notification if an exception got catched
- async file reading handling
- if-else cleanup (i.e. one liner) but it's easier to reading
- adaptive ui
- always present current score on ui, not after the match
- more unit tests
- ...
